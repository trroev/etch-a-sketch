# etch-a-sketch
etch-a-sketch project for The Odin Project

Digging deeper in to DOM manipulation.
Create an interactive page that a user can draw on a grid using the mouse pointer. Should be able to change the size of the squares within the grid, while keeping the grid size the same.

Event delegation really got me over the hump to complete this project, and I feel like it was a very valuable thing for me to learn for future projects as well.
